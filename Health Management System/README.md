# Healthcare Management System

A frontend-based **Healthcare Management System** designed to help clinic or hospital staff manage patient records and appointments efficiently. This project is developed as part of my **Frontend Development Internship** at **Code-A-Nova**.

## Project Overview
The system provides an admin-style dashboard to manage basic healthcare operations such as patient registration and appointment scheduling. Firebase is used as the backend service for authentication and real-time data storage.

This project focuses on clean UI design, frontend logic, and integration with cloud services.

## Features

- Appointment scheduling and listing
- Real-time data storage using Firebase Firestore
- Responsive user interface

## Technologies Used

- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Firebase Authentication  
- Firebase Cloud Firestore


## How It Works
- Admin logs in using Firebase Authentication
- Patient and appointment data is stored in Firebase Firestore
- JavaScript fetches and displays data dynamically in tables
